      <h3>A <em>true</em> authentic Spaghetti Carbonara, <strong>NO</strong> cream in sight!</h3>
      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Spaghetti, Buccatini or similar bronze die pasta</li>
        <li>Pecorino Romano</li>
        <li>2 Eggs</li>
        <li>1 egg Yolk</li>
        <li>Guanciale</li>
        <li>Black Pepper</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Method</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>combine eggs with grated Pecorino and mix to a thick cream</li>
        <li>Fill a large pot with water and bring to boil</li>
        <li>Heat a heavy bottomed skillet on medium low heat</li>
        <li>Thinly slice the guanciale, ensuring there is a good mix of fat and meat on each slice</li>
        <li>Add Guanciale to the pan, with <em>zero</em> oil and gently render untill crispy</li>
        <li>when water is boiling, add enough salt to reach 'salato come il mare' <br>
          <em>As salty as the sea</em>
        </li>
        <li>Add chosen pasta to the water and cook untill al dente</li>
        <li>Reserve one cup of pasta water before draining the pasta </li>
        <li>Add pasta to the guanciale pan,and turn off the heat</li>
        <li>Pour over the egg and pecorino, tossing gently in the skillet with a splash of pasta water. <br>
          It's important to turn the heat off to ensure the eggs do not become scrambled. The pasta water
        contains enough starch to emulsify the eggs, cheese and water into a thick cream. <br>
      when the cream has formed, plate up and enjoy!
